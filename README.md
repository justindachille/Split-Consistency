## Split Federated Learning

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an extensive comparison between Split Federated Learning (SFL) and Federated Learning (FL), focusing on their performance and efficacy on both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) dataset splits across multiple clients. This comparison will be executed utilizing the ResNet18 and ResNet50 architectures.

FL code adapted from `FedUV: Uniformity and Variance for Heterogeneous Federated Learning` (CVPR 2024)
SFL code adapted from `SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning` (AAAI-22)
